          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <p>This project aims to explore the potential of leveraging concert-related data with Google Trends data to predict Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in local state economies. Preliminary data analysis shows some positive correlation between concert revenue data and GDP growth as well as Google Trend popularity and GDP growth. By applying machine learning techniques to the problem,  GDP growth could be predicted within an acceptable margin, but various confounding factors limit the confidence of these results.</p>

          <h3>Data</h3>
          <p>The data extraction process for the study involved gathering information from three primary sources. The first source was the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which provided state-level quarterly GDP data. This data was used to calculate quarter-over-quarter GDP growth for each state. The second source was Wikipedia, from which concert attendance and revenue data were scraped, focusing on concert tours with crowd sizes and durations similar to the Taylor Swift and Beyonc√© tours. The third source was Google Trends, offering state-by-state search trends data. This data was used to create a "Google Trend Index" to compare the popularity of each artist by normalizing against a common search term. The combination of these data sources enabled the analysis of relationships between concert activities, Google Trends data, and economic growth.</p>

          <h3>Results</h3>
          <p>This study set out to explore the novel hypothesis that concert-related data, supplemented with Google Trends data, could serve as a predictive indicator for GDP growth in local state economies. Our approach integrated multiple data sources, including state-level quarterly GDP data, concert attendance and revenue data, and Google Trend indices. Despite the innovative nature of this approach, the results were mixed and highlighted several limitations and challenges in using such data for economic forecasting. <br>

            The preliminary analysis revealed some positive correlations between concert revenue and GDP growth, as well as between Google Trend indices and concert revenue. However, these correlations were relatively weak, suggesting that while there may be some relationship between these factors, it is not strong enough to reliably predict economic activity. This was further corroborated by the performance of our machine learning models, which achieved modest success in predicting GDP growth based on concert attendance data, but were less effective when using Google Trend indices alone. <br>
            
            A key limitation of our study was the granularity and scope of the available data. The reliance on state-level quarterly GDP data, as opposed to more granular county or city-level data, likely diluted the impact of concerts on local economies. Furthermore, the limited dataset size, focusing on only eight major concert tours, restricted our model's ability to generalize across a broader range of events and economic conditions. <br>
            
            Confounding factors also posed significant challenges. It remains unclear whether the observed correlations are indicative of a causal relationship, or merely reflect underlying economic conditions that both influence concert activity and are reflected in GDP growth. For instance, higher concert revenues might simply be a result of greater disposable income in a thriving economy, rather than a direct contributor to economic growth. <br>
            
            In conclusion, while this study provides some initial insights into the potential relationship between concert activities, Google Trends data, and GDP growth, it also underscores the complexities and limitations of such an approach. The findings suggest that while concert-related data might have some predictive value, it cannot be relied upon in isolation for accurate economic forecasting. Further research is needed, with more granular data and sophisticated analytical methods, to fully understand the potential and limitations of using cultural events as indicators of economic trends. <br>
